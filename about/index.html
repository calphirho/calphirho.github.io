                    <p>We balance our academic life at Berkeley with fun activities that strengthen our sisterhood. Together, we've ice skated in Oakland, dined at ethnic restaurants, roamed SF, watched the recent Star Wars movie, and pan-fried cookie dough at sleepovers! Duis mollis auctor gravida.

        	<p>Phi Sigma Rho is a social sorority for women in engineering and engineering technologies. Founded in 1984, Phi Sigma Rho was created by two women who found it difficult to participate in traditional sorority rush due to their demanding academic fields. Phi Sigma Rho is now established at over 25 universities across the country. Today we continue to encourage our sisters to develop the highest standard of personal integrity, strive for academic excellence, and build friendships that will last a lifetime.</p>
